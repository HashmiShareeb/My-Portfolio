This is my portfolio website where I showcase my projects, skills and more about myself. This website is made with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, 
TypeScript and also used Framer Motion for animations for the webpage. I also used Cloudinary Image component to optimize the images.This 
porfolio is deployed on Vercel and the code is available on my GitHub. I used MDX to write the project pages, so it's easier to maintain and add new projects.
