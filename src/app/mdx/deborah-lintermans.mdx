import Link from 'next/link'

During my internship at <Link target='_blank' className='text-teal-500 dark:text-teal-400 hover:text-teal-300' rel='noopener noreferrer' href="https://www.indiegroup.be/">Exsited (now Indie Group)</Link>, I got the chance to build a website for a dog coach. I used ProcessWire (a PHP-based CMS) as the foundation, styled the pages with SCSS using the BEM methodology, 
and added some interactivity with VueJS. For responsiveness and smooth layouts, I combined UIkit and Bootstrap.

The site features a services blog and a contact form, all designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing.
