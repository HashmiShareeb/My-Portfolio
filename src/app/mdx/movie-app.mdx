An app that shows the latest movies with movie ratings and a searchbar to search for your favorite movies. This app is made with <a className='text-teal-500 dark:text-teal-400 hover:text-teal-300' href="https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>The Movie Database (TMDb) API</a>. There is a light mode option as well, but it is based on the settings of your device/system where the dark mode or light mode is applied. This was a project I had to make in the class called Interaction Design, where we use CSS variables and make use of standard CSS and Vanilla JavaScript to display data and visualize it properly.
