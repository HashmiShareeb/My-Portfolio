During my internship at  <a href="https://harmony.energy/" className='text-teal-500 dark:text-teal-400  hover:text-teal-300' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">Harmony Energy</a>, I contributed to both their marketing website and their internal dashboard. I recreated the entire website using modern technologies such as Svelte 5, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, and implemented i18n using Svelte Stores for locale and language management. On the internal 'My Harmony Dashboard', I worked on multiple core features including the dynamic device management page, onboarding flow (with GoLang autodetection script), energy forecasting charts, and a logging component. I also recreated complex KPI and monitoring graphs using Grafana and custom HTML panels. Throughout the project, I focused on clean code structure, API integration, and user experience improvements.


## My Harmony Dashboard

On the internal dashboard, I worked on multiple core features including:

- **Dynamic Device Management page** with filters, validation, config views, and real data integration  
- **Onboarding Flow**, supported by a Golang autodetection script that scans MAC/IP addresses  
- **Energy forecasting and price charts** using reusable graph components  
- **A fully styled and structured logging component** - for controller diagnostics  
- **UI improvements, bug fixes, and refactoring to improve maintainability**  


I also recreated complex KPI and monitoring graphs using Grafana and custom HTML panels. Throughout the project, I focused on clean code structure, API integration, and user experience improvements. 
This was a great learning experience as I got to work with different technologies and frameworks, and also got to understand how a real-world application is built and maintained. 

This allowed me to work across both frontend and backend boundaries while improving my skills in API integration, debugging, and UI/UX.

## Device Page

One of my main tasks was the designing and developing the **Device Management Page**, a central tool for installers to view, configure, and manage all hardware connected to a site. I built the entire feature from the ground up — from UI/UX design to integrating the full front-end and back-end data flow.
*(Note: The Device Page is currently running in the development environment and has not yet been deployed to production as of today.)*

On this page, all devices are shown in clean, responsive cards, showing their name, type, configuration, and current **online/offline** status. I implemented search, filtering, and sorting options so installers can quickly locate specific hardware across even multiple large installations. On each device, there is also a details view with dynamically rendered configuration fields depending on the type, such as Huawei Sun2000 inverters, Easee chargers, or SolarGrid inverters. The inputs are fully validated to make sure configurations are done safely and accurately.

I also developed a **multi-step modal** to add, edit, and validate devices. This system encompasses input validation, handling errors, testing configurations, and providing a flexible layout for other device types in the future without having to refactor much. Once the backend API was finalized, I integrated real device data and aligned the UI with the correct API structure.

## Autodetection Script (Golang)

In support of onboarding, I've developed an autodetection script in Golang that scans the local network for compatible devices using both MAC and IP address discovery. This script executes ARP queries and response analysis to enumerate nearby hardware, detects vendor prefixes, and associated metadata like IP address, device type, and firmware.
On the frontend, I prepared the Device Page and modal components that would be used to display and add detected devices directly into the dashboard in future updates. The auto-detection script runs on the backend as a service, which lists the discovered devices for installers to swiftly review and configure.
Put together, the Device Page and the autodetection system comprise an efficient workflow that greatly enhances the way installers onboard and manage Harmony Energy devices.

## Marketing website
I completely recreated the marketing website using Svelte, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I implemented i18n using Svelte Stores to manage locales, which was a huge challenge at first but with using reactivity that Svelte 5 provides this was ultimately a smooth process. I also got the freedom to make my own layout as my intership mentor was impressed by my UI/UX and frontend skills, it was a fun project to work on and a good introduction on using Svelte which may come in handy for future projects 😉.
