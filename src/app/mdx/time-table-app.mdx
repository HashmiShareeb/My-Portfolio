import Link from 'next/link'




For the exams in SmartApp Development we had to make a project and implement all the techniques and features we have learned throughout the course, the result is a timetable app that shows the timetable of each course (which is simulated). This app is made with Flutter, using the <Link className='text-teal-500 dark:text-teal-400 hover:text-teal-300' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href="https://pub.dev/packages/calendar_view">calender view package</Link> to display the timetable. I also used firebase for the user authentication and firebase as the database to store the added event from each user. This was a project I had to make in the class called SmartApp Development, where we use Flutter and Dart to make a mobile application.
