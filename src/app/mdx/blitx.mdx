This project is built around the central question:

> **"How can I use Spring Boot and hexagonal architecture to set up a REST API and integrate it into a Vue.js frontend with PostgreSQL?"**

To explore this question, I designed and implemented **Blitx**, a full-stack proof-of-concept dashboard for managing autonomous vehicles (robotaxis).  
The project places strong emphasis on backend architecture, especially **Spring Boot** combined with **hexagonal architecture** while providing a functional  **RESTful API** with **Vue.js** frontend to demonstrate end-to-end integration.


### Why Autonomous Vehicles?
The topic of Autonomous vehicles as the domain was chosen because it naturally involves rich backend logic, such as **ride requests**, **scheduling**, **vehicle states**, and **routing** which makes it a strong fit for demonstrating the advantages of hexagonal architecture.

My research was to showcase that it is possible to use Spring Boot as a backend framework with hexagonal architecture principles to create a maintainable and testable REST API, while also integrating it with a Vue.js frontend for a complete full-stack application.
